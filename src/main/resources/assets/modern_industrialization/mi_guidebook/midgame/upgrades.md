# Upgrades!

## Machine Hull Upgrades

<ItemImage id="modern_industrialization:advanced_machine_hull" />

Yes you can! Right-click a machine with an Advanced Machine Hull to change it to MV tier: it will now accept MV cable connections only. The machine hull can also be set or cleared via the user interface.

## Overdrive Modules

<ItemImage id="modern_industrialization:overdrive_module" />

An Overdrive Module will prevent machine efficiency from going down if the machine stops processing.

The machine will consume as many EU/t as if it were continuing to process a recipe, but without doing any work. If the energy supply cannot keep up, efficiency will go down as usual.
