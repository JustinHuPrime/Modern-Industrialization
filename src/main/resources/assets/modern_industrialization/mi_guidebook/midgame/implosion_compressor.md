# Implosion Compressor!

## A Familiar Blue Gem

<ItemImage id="minecraft:diamond" />

Using Industrial TNT, the Implosion Compressor is able to compress dust and ingots of the most resistant materials. This includes Tungsten, Blastproof Alloy, Beryllium - these materials are very important for nuclear fission - and Diamonds at last!

Hopefully you have learned to check every REI recipe by now, so you should easily find that Blastproof Mixed Ingots and Tungsten Nuggets can be made with a Compressor... until you have your first Implosion Compressor of course!
