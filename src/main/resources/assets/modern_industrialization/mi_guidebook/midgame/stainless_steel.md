<ItemImage id="modern_industrialization:stainless_steel_ingot" />

Stainless Steel is the next material you will want a large quantity of. Read on to know why!

Smelting stainless steel dust in an EBF will give you hot ingots, which you can cool back into regular ingots with a Vacuum Freezer.

You can check the base materials with REI, and the exact shape with a wrench!

Once you get some digital circuits going, make sure to build a Distillation Tower. The Distillery only gives you one oil processing output, but the tower gives you ONE PER LAYER!
