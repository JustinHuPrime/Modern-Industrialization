# Your First Steel

You can macerate coke to obtain Coke Dust, which you can combine with iron to get Uncooked Steel Dust. Using the mixer will give you a better ratio, of course. Now, you will need a Steam Blast Furnace to turn that into steel.

Craft the controller, 29 Fire Clay Bricks and the same three hatches as the Coke Oven.

The Blast Furnace's structure is the same as the Coke Oven's, with Bricks replaced by Fire Clay Bricks and one extra hollow layer on top.
