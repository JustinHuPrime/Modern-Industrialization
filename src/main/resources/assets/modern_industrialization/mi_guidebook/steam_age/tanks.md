# Tanks & Barrels

Bronze tanks can store 4 buckets of fluid each, you can use them to interact with machines, and you can place them in the world.

Bronze barrels can be used to store and move 32 stacks of one item. Check the next pages for more information!

When placed in the world, you can right-click them with buckets or other tanks to transfer fluids.

Also, you can stack them in your inventory if they have the same contents. How nifty!

If you break a barrel it will keep its stored contents, and you will get an item that you can interact with.

Left-click on a barrel item with an item to insert it into the barrel.

Left-click the barrel item on an empty slot to extract some items from it.
