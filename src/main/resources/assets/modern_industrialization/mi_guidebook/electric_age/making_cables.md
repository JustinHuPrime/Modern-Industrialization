# Making Cables

Mix Coke Dust with Water in a mixer and you will get Raw Synthetic Oil, which you can burn in a Steam Blast Furnace to get Synthetic Oil. Mix it with paper and that gives you rubber sheets!

Automating this process is strongly recommended! Note that paper can be made from wood using wood pulp.

For the wires, you will need the Wiremill! Combine these wires with rubber sheets to get cables!
