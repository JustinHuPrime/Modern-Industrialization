# Portable Storage Unit

The Portable Storage Unit (PSU) can be crafted to transport energy in your inventory. It can be charged and discharged by right-clicking on any storage unit.

<Recipe id="modern_industrialization:electric_age/battery/portable_storage_unit_asbl" />

By default, it has no energy storage capacity. To add capacity, you need to fill it with batteries by either right-clicking on the PSU with batteries or by right-clicking on a battery with it. The higher level the batteries are, the more capacity they will add to the storage. You can get the battery back by right-clicking on an empty slot but any excess energy will be lost.
