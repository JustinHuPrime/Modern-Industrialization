# E = mc²

<ItemImage id="modern_industrialization:uu_matter_bucket" />

With a suitable Electrolyzer setup and a Singularity, large amounts of energy can be turned through Quantum Hawnking Radiation,  into Universally Useable Matter also known as UU Matter, the very fabric of the universe.

<ItemImage id="modern_industrialization:replicator" />

With 100 mB of UU Matter, the replicator can duplicate (almost) any item in the game!

Congratulations, it is now Yourcraft. Thanks for playing Modern Industrialization.
