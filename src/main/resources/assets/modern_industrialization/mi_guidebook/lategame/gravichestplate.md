# Gravichestplate

<ItemImage id="modern_industrialization:gravichestplate" />

The Gravichestplate uses advanced superconductor technology to invert the gravitational field around the player wearing it.

It uses EU, and can be charged by right-clicking a Storage Unit or Transformer.

Note that the current GSP technology grants fly and prevents fall damage, but it does not protected against other kinds of damage.

The Modern Industrialization engineers are trying to find a solution, but R&D is taking longer than expected.
